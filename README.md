# Introduction to Statistics

Inspired by Allen Downey's books [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/) and [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/), this is an attempt to learn Statistics using an application-centric programming approach. 

## Objective
Showcase real-life examples and what statistics to use in each of those examples. Almost every book teaches a concept and shows an example. Ultimately, every topic gets treated separately and no holistic view is presented. Here, we would take examples and see how to make sense out of it. 

## Topics covered
*Need to be updated. This is work in progress*
* Mean, Median, Mode
* Standard Deviation
* Variance
* Co-variance
* Probability Distribution
* Hypothesis Testing
* t-test, p-value, chi-squared test
* Confidence Intervals
* Confidence levels and Sigificance levels
* Resampling (and uses in Big Data)
* A/B Testing
* A simple linear regression model

## Prerequisites
* Basics of Python. User should know how to write functions; read in a text file(csv, txt, fwf) and parse them; conditional and looping constructs; using system modules like os, sys 
* It is good to know basics of the following:
    * Numpy
    * Scipy
    * Pandas
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
* Software Requirements
    * Python 2.7
    * git - so that this repo can be cloned :)  
    * Libraries from *requirements.txt*

## Optional
Users could choose to install Anaconda, if they want. Disclosure: I use Anaconda
